# NYCDA WD JavaScript Challenges #2
A project that I created during my New York Code + Design Academy Web Dev 100 class in Philly after Week 6 Lecture 2. This project was a couple of JavaScript katas.

### Assignment:
1. Assume you have some activities. Activities include `program`, `watch basketball drafts during class`, `be tall`, `eat smart food`. Write a function that takes a list of activities and a name. For each activity, log to the console: ```<name> likes to <activity>```. It should look like this:

  ```
  Roscoe likes to program
  ```
 

2. Assume we have a class with Ralph, Zack and Tony. They all took a test and here are their test scores: <br>
  `Ralph - 90` <br>
  `Zack - 80` <br>
  `Tony - 100` <br>

  For each student, log to the console their name and the grade they got. The output should look like this:
  ```
  Ralph got 90% on the test. 
  Zack got 80% on the test. 
  Tony got 100% on the test.
  ```
  
  Make sure your code can scale if we add new students to the class.
